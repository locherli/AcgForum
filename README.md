### SHORT INTRODUCTION OF THIS WEB PROJECT

This is a web project that I created for fun, it's a forum as you can see, which designed for ACG lovers to communicate. (I know nobody wants to use it cause it's sucked orz ) Anyway, let me make some simple description for you in case you want to use part of my code.

#### FRONT END

Front end was based on react. If you want to run the front end project, run the command below line by line:

```
npm start
```

or if you want to compile it and deploy this project into your server:

```
npm run build
```

#### BACKEND

Backend was based on spring boot, use maven to manage all the dependencies. If you want to compile run this command: 

```
mvn clean
mvn package
```
